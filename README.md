<h1>CRYPTOCURRENCY FORENSICS PRODUCT RESEARCH</h1>
<hr><p>Data Collection and Preprocessing
Collect Bitcoin price data from sources like CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap, and Yahoo Finance. Preprocess the data by handling missing values, normalizing features, and converting timestamps. Incorporate additional factors such as trading volume, global economic indicators, and social media sentiment.</p>
<p>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Analyze historical trends in Bitcoin prices and highlight major events. Perform correlation analysis between Bitcoin price and other variables (e.g., social media sentiment). Visualize time series data using line graphs, candlestick charts, and other statistical plots.</p>
<p>Feature Engineering:
Create features like moving averages, exponential moving averages, and relative strength index (RSI). Explore features like volatility and trading volume to improve predictions</p>
<p>Model Development:
Develop time series models like ARIMA, SARIMA, or Prophet for price prediction. Use machine learning models such as Random Forest, neural networks (LSTM, GRU), to capture complex patterns.</p>
<p>Model Optimization and Tuning:
Fine-tune models using hyperparameter optimization (e.g., Grid Search, Random Search). Apply cross-validation to ensure model robustness.</p>
<p>Backtesting and Evaluation:
Perform backtesting on the trained models to evaluate their performance. Fine-tune models based on historical predictions.</p>
<p>Deployment and Insights:
Develop a dashboard using Streamlit or Flask to allow users to interact with the models. Provide insights for traders and investors, including regulatory changes, social sentiment, etc.</p>
<p>Technologies &amp; Tools:
Programming Language:Python
Libraries:
Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow (or PyTorch for LSTM), Keras, Statsmodels, FB Prophet, Matplotlib, Seaborn Data Sources: CoinMarketCap API, Yahoo Finance API, Twitter API (for sentiment analysis) Time Series Models: ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, LSTM Data Visualization: Tableau, Plotly, or Power BI</p>
<p>Deployment:
Jupyter Notebooks, Streamlit/Flask This project structure is quite comprehensive, covering the full data science lifecycle, from data collection and preprocessing to model deployment. If you would like to work on a real-time project like this, a good starting point could be gathering historical Bitcoin price data and experimenting with different time series models, then slowly incorporating machine learning algorithms like LSTM</p><h2>General Information</h2>
